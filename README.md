## [Working With Colenda Data](https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/collections-as-data-notebooks/tree/main/Colenda%20%26%20Kaplan)

[Colenda Digital Repository at Penn Libraries](https://colenda.library.upenn.edu/) is a digital repository for digitized and born-digital material. It provides direct access and long-term stewardship for these important resources. Much of Colenda’s content consists of materials owned and digitized by the Penn Libraries, including significant collections that have been donated.

These notebooks use data from the [Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica](https://kaplan.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/) to explore how to work with data from Colenda.

## [Working With OPenn Data](https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/collections-as-data-notebooks/tree/main/OPenn%20%26%20BiblioPhilly)

[OPenn](https://openn.library.upenn.edu/) contains complete sets of high-resolution archival images of manuscripts from the University of Pennsylvania Libraries and other institutions, along with machine-readable TEI P5 descriptions and technical metadata. All materials on this site are in the public domain or released under Creative Commons licenses as Free Cultural Works.

These notebooks use data from the the [Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis project](http://bibliophilly.pacscl.org/), referred to as BiblioPhilly, to understand how to work with images and data hosted by OPenn. This project, pursued by the Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries, contains digital editions of more than 400 western European medieval and early modern codices, plus selected leaves and cuttings from the following PACSCL member institutions.
