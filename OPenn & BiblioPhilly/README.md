## Working With OPenn Data
[OPenn](https://openn.library.upenn.edu/) contains complete sets of high-resolution archival images of manuscripts from the University of Pennsylvania Libraries and other institutions, along with machine-readable TEI P5 descriptions and technical metadata. All materials on this site are in the public domain or released under Creative Commons licenses as Free Cultural Works.

These notebooks use data from the the [Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis project](http://bibliophilly.pacscl.org/), referred to as BiblioPhilly, to understand how to work with images and data hosted by OPenn. This project, pursued by the Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries, contains digital editions of more than 400 western European medieval and early modern codices, plus selected leaves and cuttings from the following PACSCL member institutions.

* Retrieve Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis Data & Images: In this notebook we'll have a preliminary look at data and images harvested from OPenn. What kind of data, images, and files can we access in OPenn? We'll introduce the differences between administrative and descriptive metadata, how to calculate basic shape/stats of the data, as well as how to access and download images and data in OPenn.

* Explore Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis Metadata: In this notebook we'll have a preliminary look at metadata harvested from OPenn. How are manuscripts distributed over time? How are manuscripts described? Which places are associated with manuscripts? To answer these questions and more, we'll extract relevant data, see what's there, and create visualizations.

* Build an Ebook from Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis: (forthcoming)

The dataset for this notebook works with items from the **Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis** project. Members of the [Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries (PACSCL)](http://pacscl.org/) catalogued and digitized medieval Western European manuscripts with the generous support of the [Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)](https://www.clir.org/), via its Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives initiative. All images have been released into the public domain. More information about the collection can be found at [https://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/](https://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/).
