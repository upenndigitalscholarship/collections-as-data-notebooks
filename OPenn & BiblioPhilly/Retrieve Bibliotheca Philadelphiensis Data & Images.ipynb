    "The dataset for this notebook works with items from the **Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis** project. Members of the [Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries (PACSCL)](http://pacscl.org/) catalogued and digitized medieval Western European manuscripts with the generous support of the [Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)](https://www.clir.org/), via its Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives initiative. All images have been released into the public domain. More information about the collection can be found at [https://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/](https://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/). \n",
